# Cooler Stages

### SUBMIT ANY ISSUES USING THE LINK ABOVE

No it doesn't work with StageAesthetic or CoolerEclipse. 3 themes that change the skybox, materials, and post processing for stages 1-5, doesn't work on modded or special stages. There's a config for keeping the vanilla stage, on by default.
